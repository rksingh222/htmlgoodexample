<h1>Image Zoom</h1>

<p>Mouse over the image:</p>

<div class="img-zoom-container">
  <img id="myimage" src="image1.jpg" width="300" height="240">
  <div id="myresult" class="img-zoom-result"></div>
</div>

<p>The image must be placed inside a container with relative positioning.</p>
<p>The result can be put anywhere on the page, but must have the class name "img-zoom-result".</p>
<p>Make sure both the image and the result have IDs. These IDs are used when a javaScript initiates the zoom effect.</p>

<script>
// Initiate zoom effect:
imageZoom("myimage", "myresult");
